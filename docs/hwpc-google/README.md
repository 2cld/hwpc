To get your business on Google Maps, you need to create or claim a free Google Business Profile at google.com/business, verify your business (often by postcard, phone, or email), and then add details like hours, photos, and services to optimize it for customers. This process makes your business visible in local searches and on Maps, helping customers find you.

2. Go to Google Business Profile: Visit google.com/business and click "Manage now" or "Get started".
3. Add Your Business:
   - Search for your business name; if it appears, claim the existing listing.
   - If not, select "Create a business with this name".
   - Enter your exact business name, category, and whether you have a physical location or serve customers at their location.
   - Provide Contact Info: Add your phone number and website (or get a free one from Google).
